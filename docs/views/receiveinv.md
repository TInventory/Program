# Update Products
![Update Products view][1]

The *Update Products* view allows the addition of on-hand quantity of each product.

To add quantity to a product, provide the following two pieces of information in
 the top two text fields:

* **Product ID:** The unique ID of the product to add quantity to.
* **Quantity to add:** The amount to add to the on-hand quantity of the product.

For convenience, a copy of the [View Inventory][2] view is provided below the
 *Update Product* button. Clicking on any item in the table will have its ID
 automatically placed in the *Product ID* text field.

After entering this information, and as long as the product ID and quantity are
 valid, clicking on *Update Product* will update the quantity of the product.
 You may also press the *Enter* key on your keyboard while your cursor is in the
 *Qty to Add* text field, as this will provide the same functionality as clicking
 on *Update Product*.
