# Update Products
![Update Products view][1]

The *Update Products* view allows the addition of on-hand quantity of each product.

The left hand side of the view provides a small version of the [View Inventory][2]
 view. It is meant to be a convenience to see what products exist in the system
 and what they're on-hand quantity is.

 **NOTE: Currently the view does not update after adding quantity. You will need**
  **to close and reopen the view in order to see the changes.**

To add quantity to a product, use the right hand side of the window, and provide
 two pieces of information.

* **Product ID:** The unique ID of the product to add quantity to.
* **Quantity to add:** The amount to add to the on-hand quantity of the product.

After entering this information, and as long as the product ID and quantity are
 valid, hitting *Enter* on your keyboard while the cursor is in the *Qty to Add*
 text field will update the quantity of the product. You can tell that the change
 has been made if, after hitting *Enter*, the two text fields clear their values.

**NOTE: As of right now, there is no button to click to add the quantity to the**
 **product. Hitting *Enter* while the cursor is in the *Qty to Add* text field**
 **will add the quantity to the specified product.**
