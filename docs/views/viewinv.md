# View Inventory
![View Inventory tab][1]

The *View Inventory* view will display all of the current inventory in a single,
 sortable table.

The table currently has the following four columns:

* **ID:** A unique product ID that can be used to reference this certain product.
* **Name:** A human-friendly name for the product.
* **Price:** The unit price for the product.
* **Quantity:** The current quantity on-hand for that product.

Each column of the table can be sorted for convenience. Clicking once on any column
 will sort the column in ascending order, and clicking it again will sort the column
 in descending order.

No data can be changed from this view. To add new products, visit [Create New Products][2].
 To add quantity, visit [Update/Receive Inventory][3]. To sell inventory, visit [Sell Inventory][4].
