* **Name:** The human-friendly name of the product, used for displaying.
* **ID:** A unique ID that can be used to reference this item in the database.
* **Price:** The unit price for this product.

After entering all of this information into their respective text fields, clicking

 with a quantity of 0. To increase its quantity, use the [Update/Receive Inventory][2]
 view.
