# Reports
![Reports view][1]

The *Reports* view allows the export of data from the program into CSV files
 for use in external programs. Currently, there is support to export all invoices,
 the current state of the inventory, and all customers.

To export a set of data, click the *CSV* button next to the set of data you would
 like to export. A save dialog box will open. Choose the location to save the CSV
 file to. After clicking *Save*, the file will be written, and will be available
 for you to use in another program.
