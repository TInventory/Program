# Basic Usage

**NOTE: As it currently stands, the program does *NOT* connect to an external database.**
 **The program will *NOT* currently save any changes between runs. When the database**
 **protocol is implemented, you will need to specify your own database to connect to.**

Upon opening the program for the first time, you will notice a seemingly blank screen.
 All parts of the program are contained in *views* in the `Actions` menu in the menu
 bar at the top of the program. Clicking any one of these options will open that
 view in a new tab inside the main window.

![Menu Bar with Actions Menu expanded][1]

![Open Tabs][2]

You may only have one tab of each view open at once. To close any of the tabs,
 click on the *x* in the tab that you want to close.

To learn more about any of the views, choose its corresponding help page in the sidebar.
