# Basic Usage

**NOTE: The program *ONLY* connects to our test database.**

Upon starting the program, you will need to specify login information. After doing
 so, you will be brought to the main view.

![Login View][3]

Upon opening the main view for the first time, you will notice a seemingly blank screen.
 All parts of the program are contained in *views* in the `Actions` menu in the menu
 bar at the top of the program. Clicking any one of these options will open that
 view in a new tab inside the main window.

**NOTE: Not all of the views listed in these help documents may be visible to you.**
 **This would be because only views you have access to are listed in the program.**
 **To get access to other views, contact someone with administrator privileges.**

![Menu Bar with Actions Menu expanded][1]

![Open Tabs][2]

You may only have one tab of each view open at once. To close any of the tabs,
 click on the *x* in the tab that you want to close.

To learn more about any of the views, choose its corresponding help page in the sidebar.
